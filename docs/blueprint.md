# **App Name**: CareerCompass

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using Firebase Authentication.
- Interactive Quiz: Present a series of timed, multiple-choice questions to assess user interests and strengths.
- Career Path Analysis: Use AI as a tool to analyze quiz responses and identify the most suitable career paths, streams, and educational requirements.
- Personalized Career Report: Generate detailed reports for top career matches, including descriptions, required skills, roadmaps, salary expectations, and future outlook.
- Career Exploration & Favorites: Allow users to browse other careers, view details, and save their preferred options to Firestore.
- Admin Dashboard: Provide an admin interface for managing quiz questions, career data, and user information. The admin can create and update questions. If appropriate the admin can use the AI tool to create updated text for any aspect of any career in the system. (But the app doesn't automatically and regularly attempt to improve all stored content.)
- Data Storage: Store quiz responses, user data, and career results in Cloud Firestore.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#78B9EB), evoking trust, knowledge, and guidance. The blue is bright, but not overly saturated, making it approachable for younger users.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), providing a clean and neutral backdrop that highlights the app's content.
- Accent color: Teal (#45A29E), drawing attention to key interactive elements like buttons and progress indicators. This choice is analogous to sky blue and feels familiar, modern and reassuring.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for titles. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for readability in longer descriptions.
- Use clear and modern icons to represent career paths, skills, and features. Icons should be consistent in style (e.g., outline or filled) to maintain a unified look.
- Clean and minimal layout with a focus on readability. Use whitespace effectively to avoid clutter and emphasize key information. The quiz interface should be intuitive, with clear progress indicators.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement. For example, a smooth countdown timer during the quiz and a satisfying animation upon career result reveal.
